# How to use

Prepare an HTML canvas and a "current frame" input (I use `input type=range`). Pass them into PresentationLayer constructor.

```javascript
canvas = document.getElementById('board')
seeker = document.getElementById('seeker')
var animatronica = new PresentationLayer(canvas, seeker)
```

To **imitate playback**, just increase your current frame input progressively â€” the canvas will react.

To **generate a GIF** of the movie, call `generateGif`. It takes some time, hence the callback.

```javascript
animatronica.generateGif (objectUrl) ->
  window.open(objectUrl)
```
